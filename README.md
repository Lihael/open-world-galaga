# open-world-galaga

Open World Galaga is a game loosely based off of the 1981 arcade title “Galaga”, as shown here. The game would center around a player controlled ship fighting against groups of moving enemies in an open, traversable map, as distinct from Galaga where the player is limited to a small area in the bottom of the screen. Enemies will be generated in waves at different locations which the player will have to defeat to clear levels.
